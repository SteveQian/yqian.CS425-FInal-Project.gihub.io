I created a 2d game using Unity, Human try to find the spider(player).
The spider takes damage when it collided with the spider.
The spider also can take damage back to the human when they collied.

The spider can shot the human and eat the healing stuff to get heal.

I used several technical components. Rigid body for moving the character. Collision detection for detecting the collision, motion planning build by the finite state machine which choosing a state to present animation. AI finds a path to the player using A* pathfinding.
